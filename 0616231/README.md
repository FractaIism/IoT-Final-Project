## 6/6

### awesome work 1:

I want to let the platform be longer, so I try to use my own image except 'https://wacamoto.github.io/NS-Shaft-Tutorial/assets/', but I fail

### try smartphone(flask):

Now I can use this to create my own smartphone device in my laptop.
But sadly, when I use my phone to open the website, the acceleration doesn't show well, I think this is because the website is actually create in my laptop not in my phone, so it can't correctly show the acceleration value.

### try smartphone(github.io):

I put the same my code as "try smartphone(flask)" in this and open by typing "https://pengsc0616.github.io" on Chrome, and it show perfectly. 
It can also do well on mobile phone

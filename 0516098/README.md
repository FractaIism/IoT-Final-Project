Hopefully functional.\
\
6/10\
Submit Battleship v1.1\
Fixed bug in Battleship where the game gets stuck due to a control message not reaching the other side.\
Next up: Change device model to have separate channels for Attack and Reveal messages. Might reduce DF "traffic jams".\
\
6/11\
Submit Battleship v1.2\
Fixed bug where game gets stuck if players act too fast. Should be mostly operational now (hopefully).\
Next up: Beautify the game, deal with the game over part, and whatever else comes to mind later.\
P.S. Moved over to 4.iottalk.tw cuz 5.iottalk.tw kept giving me 500 Internal Server Error.\
\
6/13\
Added colors, animations, text positioning, game over conditions, ...\
Next (optional): Organize the code, allow modifying parameters, game intro (start button), fix UI for mobile website...\
P.S. 5.iottalk.tw is still broken\

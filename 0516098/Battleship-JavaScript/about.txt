Battleship v1.3:
2-player Battleship game

How to play:
1) Open two tabs on the PC with index.html, link them in IoTTalk as in the screenshot
2) DA with odd number goes first, go to that tab and click a square on the Enemy Gameboard, switch to the other tab to see the result on the Ally Gameboard (should take < 5 secs)
3) Optionally watch the console on both tabs for all the nonsensical output (debugger will trigger in case the game gets stuck so you can watch console output)
4) Make a move on the even-numbered DA and watch the result on the odd-numbered DA
5) Voila!? Tell me if it bugs out again

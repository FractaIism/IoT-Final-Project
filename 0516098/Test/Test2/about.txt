Test2:
Try to measure the time interval between data received at the output device when the input device provides a continuous stream of data.
(find out how fast IoTTalk can send and receive data)

How to use:
1) Open input device "input_dummy_XXXXXX" in cmd (python Dummy_Device_sender/DAI.py)
2) Open output device "output_dummy_YYYYYY" (Dummy_Device_receiver/index.html)
3) Make a project in 5.iottalk.tw with a dummy device having both IDF and ODF, and link them accordingly
4) As DAI.py sends data every 0.2 seconds, watch how fast IoTTalk can receive it (watch the join node), as well as how fast the ODF can receive it (watch console)

Result:
IoTTalk receives data every 1~2 seconds, and our dummy output device receives data every 1.5~2 seconds. With this much lag, realtime games cannot function properly through IoTTalk.

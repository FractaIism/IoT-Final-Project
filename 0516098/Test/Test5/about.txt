Test5:
Try to achieve both input and output (push/pull data to/from IoTTalk) using Javascript. Code taken from Smartphone DA and reduced to only what is needed.

Steps:
1) Open index.html and watch the console. Simple. Doesn't even require opening IoTTalk (for this test). Fiddle with the code to test the limits.

Results:
> Sending (array of) strings WORKS
> Sending (array of) numbers WORKS
> Sending a mix of both WORKS
> Sending data to a DF not in the DM WORKS (as long as you include it in the profile df_list)
> Registering with a nonexistent DM name DOESN'T WORK (tried changing Smartphone to Smartporn...no luck)

Extra:
> Observing the "pull orientation" logs (outputs "s-XX-YY"), we can see that the time difference between a pull and its corresponding push is > 1 sec. Thought this would've been a chance to fix the lag, but apparently nope.

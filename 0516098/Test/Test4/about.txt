To put a nail in the coffin, here's a demo of controlling the game character using the IoTTalk smartphone cyberdevice.

Steps:
1) Go to 5.iottalk.tw and make a project with a smartphone and a dummy device (ODF), join them using 'passon' function (shown in Test1)
2) Open 'Smartphone' cyberdevice in your smartphone and index.html in your pc, then link them in IoTTalk (device name in webpage title)
3) Play the game (modified for testing purposes) (see the console for data arrival times)
